# WhisperingPines
Repository for Whispering Pines

Hey there, you brave (or just plain crazy) soul. You’ve just stumbled into the dark heart of Whispering Pines — a Roblox horror experience that’s gonna grab you by the neck and not let go.

This ain’t your grandma’s bedtime story. You’re here for chills, thrills, and a whole lotta “what the hell was that?!” moments. So buckle up, keep your eyes peeled, and remember: the shadows are watching… and they love visitors.

Feel free to poke around the repository, but don’t be surprised if things get a little… uncomfortable. And hey, if you break something, don’t worry — we’ll send the monsters after you.
