John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

This game is currently being revamped.

We've heard rumors of a 2nd Rake? Please report this issue if you see it in game!

Combat is extremely discouraged. Never have your goal be to kill him, even in large numbers you are likely to fail. It's a survival game, not a fighting game.

Controls:

W,A,S,D - Movement
LShift - Sprint
C - Crouch
LShift + C - Slide
LMB - Use Item
E - Interact

Recent updates:

- Remastered player animations (see contributor menu for the beautiful man who made them)
- Removal of Halloween Decorations
- Changes to the menu camera & general stability
- Flare Gun (Does not call a supply drop. Don't try it. Shoot Rake with it.)
- Fixed crashing issue, caused by the blood system. Looking into this issue further.

Tips:

Holding left click charges a melee weapon, the longer you hold it the more powerful it becomes HOWEVER if you hold it for too long it will start to decrease and randomize.

The flare gun will cause Rake to run away if you shoot him. It does not call a supply drop.

The mystery boxes spawn around the map at night and include exclusive items. Test your luck, but don't be greedy!

Never stand still and constantly check your back, always be cautious when turning a corner because he might be waiting.
