Tips:

Sliding or crouching can reduce fall damage if timed correctly.

Holding left click charges a melee weapon, the longer you hold it the more powerful it becomes HOWEVER if you hold it for too long it will start to decrease and randomize.

Never stand still and constantly check your back, always be cautious when turning a corner because he might be waiting.
