Recent updates:

- Rake target selection reworked, Rake now considers many different variables about each player while selecting them as a target, 
- New Friendly Fire option (Players highlighted in red while holding a weapon have it enabled, if you also have ff enabled, then they can attack you.)
- Fixed weapon bug where it just doesn't work
- 4/1/24 reverted
- Found a huge bug with saving options, fixed now.
- Blood Hour added after a LOT of requesting.

Tips:

Holding left click charges a melee weapon, the longer you hold it the more powerful it becomes HOWEVER if you hold it for too long it will start to decrease and randomize.

Players highlighted in red while holding a weapon have Friendly Fire enabled, if you also have Friendly Fire enabled, then they can attack you.

The flare gun will cause Rake to run away if you shoot him. It does not call a supply drop and it never will. Cry about it.

The mystery boxes spawn around the map at night and include exclusive items. Test your luck, but don't be greedy!

Never stand still and constantly check your back, always be cautious when turning a corner because he might be waiting.
