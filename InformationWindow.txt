Tips:

Holding left click charges a melee weapon, the longer you hold it the more powerful it becomes HOWEVER if you hold it for too long it will start to decrease and randomize.

The flare gun will cause Rake to run away if you shoot him. It does not call a supply drop and it never will. Cry about it.

The mystery boxes spawn around the map at night and include exclusive items. Test your luck, but don't be greedy!

Never stand still and constantly check your back, always be cautious when turning a corner because he might be waiting.
